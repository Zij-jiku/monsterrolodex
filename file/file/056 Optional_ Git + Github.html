However, if you have never used git and Github before, you may want to go to <strong>Appendix 1:&nbsp;Key Developer Concepts</strong> at the bottom of the course video player, and watch the videos titled <em>Git +&nbsp;Github&nbsp; </em>and<em> Git + Github 2</em>. They are both videos from my other course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/?referralCode=FFF295AECF3594CE440E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Web Developer:&nbsp;Zero to Mastery</strong></a><strong> </strong>which I have decided to include for those that need them.<br><br>Otherwise, let's keep going to the next video :)<br><strong><br>By the way, just a heads up!<br><br></strong>Recently Github has decided to rename the original branch from <code>master</code> to <code>main</code> .&nbsp;If you want to find out the reason why they did this, you can read about it <a href="https://github.com/github/renaming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;<em>(main is less offensive than master).<br><br></em>For this reason, for any new Github repositories created from now on <em>(old ones will stay the same with master as the main branch)</em>, you will have to use <code>main</code> instead of <code>master</code>. So anytime you see us use master when we are making changes to our master project, simply replace it with main for your own project!<br><br>For example if you see a command like:<br><code>git push origin master</code><br><br>it should now be:<br><code>git push origin main</code> </p></p>
